Breakout but themed around hell for the Halloween season

## Implementation
I included a number of aesthetic features themed around hell.
I changed the ball out for a human skull which spins around as it flies.
I gave the bricks anguished faces
I gave the paddle eyes which follow the ball
I added screen shake effects when the ball hits against something
I added background music (all songs from the band Death)
I added a background to each level
I gave the ball and paddle highlights which activate when they are hit
I added fade in and fade out effects to the bricks.
I added loads of sound effects (the death sound in particular I am very proud of)
I added shader effects to the main menu
I added fonts and stylized the main menu as well as the game over screen
